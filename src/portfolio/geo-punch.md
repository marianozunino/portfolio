#### Overview

Geo Punch is a GoLang and Flutter project that allows users to clock in and out for work.

#### Motivation

A client approached me with a unique requirement for tracking employee attendance.
The current method involved manually managing attendance through spreadsheets,
which was tedious and prone to errors.
The client needed a more dynamic and automated solution that would not require
employees to install any apps on their mobile devices.

#### Solution

Geo Punch was developed to meet these needs using GoLang for the backend and
Flutter for the frontend. The frontend was designed as a Progressive Web App (PWA)
to eliminate the need for installations on mobile devices. While PWAs can have
limitations, the client accepted these in favor of the convenience provided.

The key features of Geo Punch include:
- **Automated Clock-In/Clock-Out**: Employees can easily record their attendance.
- **Report Generation**: The system can generate reports for overtime, permissions, late arrivals, and more.
- **No Installation Required**: As a PWA, Geo Punch works directly from the browser, providing a seamless user experience.

Geo Punch effectively automates the attendance tracking process, reducing manual effort and improving accuracy.
