Hello!

I'm Mariano, a software engineer from Montevideo, Uruguay. I pursued my Tecnólogo en Informática
degree at <a href="https://www.fing.edu.uy/" target="_blank">Fing</a> after several years
working as an IT Technician (which comes handy when dealing with infrastructure).

I enjoy expanding my knowledge and although I wouldn't call myself a bookworm,
I love reading compelling books, especially those on computer science.

Building side projects is another passion of mine, both for enjoyment and profit.
For the former, I often collaborate with my brother <a href="https://totozunino.github.io/portfolio/" target="_blank">Mathias</a>.

In addition to my software work, I have a strong interest in teaching and sharing
knowledge. As a professor at FING, I strive to contribute to the community by
training and educating others.

Did I mention that I have two lovely dogs 🐕❤️? They are named <a href="/assets/rocco.jpg">Rocco</a> and <a href="/assets/mora.jpg">Mora</a>!
And here's a photo of them together <a href="/assets/babies.jpg">Dogs</a>.
