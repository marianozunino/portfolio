## Why 0x0.st?

I've known about **0x0.st** for a while and have been using it regularly. It’s a super simple file-hosting service—perfect for quickly sharing files with just a single `curl` command.

But recently, I needed to share some files **privately**, which led me to rethink my approach.

## The Good

0x0.st is **effortless**. No accounts, no setup—just:

```bash
curl -F'file=@myfile.txt' https://0x0.st
```

And you're done.

## The Bad

The problem? **It’s not mine.**
I don’t control the service. I don’t own it. I don’t run it.

While 0x0.st is convenient, relying on an external service for sensitive files isn’t ideal.

## The Solution

The source code for 0x0.st is [available](https://git.0x0.st/mia/0x0), but it's written in **Python**—and honestly, I neither know nor care much about Python.

So, like any good engineer, I **reinvented the wheel** and [rewrote it in Go](https://github.com/marianozunino/dump). It may not have all the features, but it works for me.

## The Result

**Three Doritos después…**

### How I Use It in zshrc

```zsh
upload_file() {
  [[ -z "$1" || ! -f "$1" ]] && { echo "Usage: $0 <file>"; return 1; }

  local url="https://domain.example"
  local response=$(curl -i -F"file=@$1" "$url")
  local link=$(echo "$response" | tail -n1)
  local token=$(echo "$response" | grep -i "X-Token:" | awk '{print $2}' | tr -d '\r')

  [[ -n "$link" ]] && { echo -n "$link" | wl-copy; echo "✓ Uploaded: $link (copied to clipboard)"; }
  [[ -n "$token" ]] && echo "Management token: $token"
}

alias drop='upload_file'
alias dump='upload_file'
```
