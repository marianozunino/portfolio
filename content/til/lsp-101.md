## What is LSP?

Today I finally got around to checking out the Language Server Protocol (LSP). I've been curious about it for a while and wanted to see how it actually works under the hood.

LSP is basically just a standard way for text editors and language servers to talk to each other. These servers give you cool stuff like autocompletion, go-to-definition, and error checking. The awesome part? You write one server and it works with a bunch of different editors (VS Code, Neovim, Emacs, etc.) instead of having to build separate plugins for each one. Pretty neat, right?

## Creating a Minimal LSP Server

To get the hang of LSP, I threw together a quick emoji autocomplete server in Go. Nothing fancy - it just does one job: suggests emojis when you type certain keywords.

Here's the basic structure of my implementation:


```go
package main

import (
	"flag"
	"fmt"
	"github.com/tliron/commonlog"
	"github.com/tliron/glsp"
	protocol "github.com/tliron/glsp/protocol_3_16"
	"github.com/tliron/glsp/server"
	_ "github.com/tliron/commonlog/simple"
)

const lsName = "Emoji Autocomplete LS"
var (
	version string = "0.0.1"
	handler protocol.Handler
)

var emojiMapper = map[string]string{
	"party":	"ðŸŽ‰"
	"bomb":		"ðŸ’£"
	// ...other emoji mappings...
}
```

The core functionality consists of three main handlers:

1. **Initialize** - Sets up the server and declares its capabilities
2. **Shutdown** - Cleans up when the server is shutting down
3. **TextDocumentCompletion** - Provides the actual completion items (emojis)

The completion handler is where the real work happens:

```go
func textDocumentCompletion(context *glsp.Context, params *protocol.CompletionParams) (any, error) {
	var completionItems []protocol.CompletionItem
	for word, emoji := range emojiMapper {
		emojiCopy := emoji
		completionItems = append(completionItems, protocol.CompletionItem{
			Label:      word,
			Detail:     &emojiCopy,
			InsertText: &emojiCopy,
		})
	}
	return completionItems, nil
}
```

This function returns a list of completion items, each with a label
(the keyword like "happy") and the text to insert (the emoji like "ðŸ˜€").

## The Main Function

The `main` function wires everything together:

```go
func main() {
	versionFlag := flag.Bool("version", false, "print version information")
	flag.Parse()
	if *versionFlag {
		printVersion()
		return
	}
	commonlog.Configure(2, nil)
	handler = protocol.Handler{
		Initialize:             initialize,
		Shutdown:               shutdown,
		TextDocumentCompletion: textDocumentCompletion,
	}
	server := server.NewServer(&handler, lsName, true)
	server.RunStdio()
}
```

This sets up the handler with our three functions and runs the server using standard input/output for communication.

## Using the LSP Server in Neovim

After compiling the server, I could use it in Neovim with this simple configuration:

```lua
vim.lsp.start({
	name = "my-lsp",
	cmd = { "./my-lsp" },
	root_dir = vim.fn.getcwd(),
})
````

and then source it:

```shell
source test.lua
```

## What I Learned

Building this little LSP server taught me some cool stuff:

1. **How LSP is Built** - Now I get how the whole thing works. Your editor is the client, and it talks to the language server using a standard way of communicating.

2. **Servers Tell What They Can Do** - When a server starts up, it basically says "Hey, I can do completions, formatting, etc." so the editor knows what to ask for.

3. **Back-and-Forth Talking** - The editor asks things like "what completions should I show here?" and the server answers back with the goods. It's just sending JSON messages back and forth.

4. **Start Small, Add More Later** - You don't have to build everything at once. I started with just completions, but I could add more cool features later.

5. **Super Easy to Hook Up** - Once your server is working, plugging it into different editors is way easier than I thought it would be.

## Next Steps

This was just a super basic version, but it's a good jumping-off point. Some stuff I might add later:

- Make the server keep track of what's in the file as you type
- Add those little pop-ups when you hover over an emoji to show what it means
- Maybe throw in some error checking for custom stuff
- Add auto-formatting so things look nice

The cool part? When I add any of this stuff to my server, bam! It works in pretty much any editor that knows LSP - VS Code, Emacs, Neovim, whatever.
