#### Overview

Go Sync Cal is a GoLang project that enables the synchronization of two Google Calendars. This tool is particularly useful for individuals or organizations that need to maintain consistent schedules across multiple email accounts.

#### Motivation

Managing multiple Google Calendars across different accounts became a challenge, leading to overlapping schedules and miscommunications about availability. This project addresses the need for a seamless way to keep calendars in sync.

#### Solution

Go Sync Cal was developed to synchronize two Google Calendars, copying events from one to the other. It allows users to redact sensitive information such as the summary, description, location, and other event properties to prevent data leakage.

The project leverages the Google Calendar API and is built using GoLang. It effectively resolves the issue of maintaining synchronized schedules across different Google accounts, ensuring better organization and time management.
