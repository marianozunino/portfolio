#### Overview

OpenSSL TS Wrapper is a modern, dependency-free OpenSSL wrapper written in TypeScript.

#### Motivation

While working on a project, I encountered numerous challenges when using OpenSSL with Node.js. These included parsing strings, validating outputs, handling exit codes, and managing other boilerplate tasks. The complexity and repetitive nature of these tasks highlighted the need for a simpler, more intuitive interface.

#### Solution

To address these issues, I developed the OpenSSL TS Wrapper in TypeScript. This wrapper standardizes the interaction with OpenSSL binaries, offering a consistent and easy-to-use interface. Although it's not groundbreaking, it significantly reduces the complexity and boilerplate code required for working with OpenSSL in Node.js.
