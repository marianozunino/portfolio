#### Overview

This is the repository for my personal portfolio website, which you're currently browsing. It's built with Hugo, a fast and flexible static site generator.

#### Motivation

I needed a simple, fast way to showcase my projects and share a bit about myself. Originally built with Eleventy, I migrated it to Hugo because I was fed up with constantly updating dependencies and dealing with too much configuration in Eleventy. Gotta love the Go tooling - so much simpler to maintain.

#### Solution

The portfolio site features:

- Clean, minimalist design with dark mode support
- Fast loading times through static site generation
- Responsive layout that works on all devices
- Project sorting and navigation between portfolio items
- Integration with GitHub for showing source code links

Built using Hugo's templating system with custom layouts and styling, the site prioritizes content over complexity. It includes meta tags for better SEO and social sharing, along with schema markup for improved search engine visibility.

This site serves as a simple hub for my projects, but as I've mentioned elsewhereâ€”my portfolio is just a collection of things I tinker with to keep learning. Some of them are honestly just crap I threw together, while others actually turned out useful. Either way, they keep me sharp and let me play with new tech without the constraints of work projects.
